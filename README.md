# Weather App

Simple weather app that uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the weather for a given city.

## Description

This app was created as a way to learn how to use the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and to practice making API calls with Python. The app uses the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library to make the API calls and the [Tkinter](https://tkdocs.com/) library to create the GUI.

## Getting Started

### API Key

Visit the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) website to get an API key. Once you have an API key, create a file called `api_key.txt` in the root directory of the project and add the following line to the file:

```python
YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

### Dependencies

* Python 3.8.5
* requests 2.25.1
* Tkinter 8.6

### Installing

* Clone the repository
* Install the dependencies
* Add your API key to the `api_key.txt` file
* Run the `main.py` or `website.py` file
* Enjoy!
